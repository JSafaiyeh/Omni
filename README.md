Implemented:
#Twitter
Twitter provides a Twitter API Client with Fabric. 


Read the [Twitter Documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/twitter-kit/android/api) for more information.  

#Facebook
RestFB created a client for Facebook.
Note: Facebook does not allow Android apps to use the "read_stream" permission anymore. Therefore, there is no longer a way to retrieve News Feed posts and displaying them. The implementation provided cannot be used in an app that is live in the market, unless approved by Facebook.


Read the [RestFB Wiki](http://restfb.com/) for more information.
